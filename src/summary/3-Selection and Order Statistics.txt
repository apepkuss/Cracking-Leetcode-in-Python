Statistics refers to methods for combining a large amount of data (such as the scores of the whole class on a homework)
into a single number of small set of numbers that give an overall flavor of the data. The phrase order statistics refers
to statistical methods that depend only on the ordering of the data and not on its numerical values.

So, for instance, the average of the data, while easy to compute and very important as an estimate of a central value,
is not an order statistic. The mode (most commonly occurring value) also does not depend on ordering, although the most
efficient methods for computing it in a comparison-based model involve sorting algorithms. The most commonly used order
statistic is the median, the value in the middle position in the sorted order of the values. Again we can get the median
easily in O(n log n) time via sorting, but maybe it's possible to do better? We'll see that the answer is yes, O(n).

Here is a paper to talk about this kind of issue: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/960125.html.
