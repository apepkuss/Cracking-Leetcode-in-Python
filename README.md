# Cracking Leetcode in Python

The motivation of this project is to share some ideas with (and also expect comments from) any one who has interests in cracking algorithm questions for technical interview. The majority of algorithm questions discussed and presented here are from leetcode.com, which is one of the most popular technical interview training website.

A free ebook in pdf format is also presented in this repo, including its latex source code. So, any one can customize their own ebook for future reading.

Any comment on any thing in this repo is welcomed. Share your ideas with us and let's crack them together!

Have fun!
